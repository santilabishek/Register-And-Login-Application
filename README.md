# Register-And-Login-Application
This is an project code of registration and login using MySQL database.
    --> This project is an simple Registration and Login process using MySQL database. 
    --> Here I have used the Java Technology to do the project.
    --> I have Created an Registration page using the Jframes and an Login page with the forget password options.
    --> While registering the code will automatically get the password from user and it will encrypt the password and It will save it in the database.
    --> In the same way the forget password options using the Encryption function.. Here the forget password option will work by answering certain questions, The question and answer will be set by the user while Registering.
    --> And when the user is asking to reset the password...The questions set by the user will be asked for user to confirm an verification. After the confirmation the user can reset the password.
